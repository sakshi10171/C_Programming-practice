# C_Programming-practice

This repository contains my **C programming practice programs**.  
I have written these programs while learning the fundamentals of C programming.

##  Topics Covered
- Basic C syntax
- Loops (for, while)
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Number programs
- Pattern programs
- Mathematical logic
